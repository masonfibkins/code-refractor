# code-refractor
The purpose of this assignment is to have a real-world client like experience. We were given code that we needed to modify and specifically make it more accessible. Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can still use a website with assistive technologies. For this assignment I made sure there were semantic HTML elements, in a logical structure. I also added alt attributes to the images, as well ad the heading attributes being in order. I also made the title element more descriptive. Lastly I updated the CSS selectors and properties to be concise and organized to match the HTML code I changed along with making the code cleaner.
